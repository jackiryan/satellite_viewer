# Satellite Viewer

This code is a prototype of a widget I want to add to a personal website. It will contain representations of various spacecraft in orbit around the Earth with orbit tracks and name labels. Currently, the code implements a globe with accurate representations of day and night that rotates at the same rate as real time (i.e., 24 hours per rotation). The calculations for the globe are not perfect, and have been modified for better aesthetics.

## Building and Running
This is a simple vite project. It can be run with `npm run dev` and accessed in the browser at localhost:5173
